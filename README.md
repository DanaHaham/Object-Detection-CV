# Object-Detection-CV
In this project, I implemented a transfer learning task on the Mask R-CNN architecture to detect three objects: drone, bird, and aircraft. 
The detection is shown in both their bounding box and label in three videos.
I utilized the "Drone_Bird_Aircraft Image Dataset" from Roboflow.
